# SheepherdApp
A desktop game app for fun. Aim to simulate the evolusion on a grassland.

Sheep eat grass. Wolves eat sheep. Grass grow itself slowly. Sheep look for higher volume grassland block when wolves always tracing sheep.

By adjust the grow speed & eating speed & animal move speed & animal lifetime, totally different results. 
You will find it is quite difficult to balance. Mostly, tragic.
